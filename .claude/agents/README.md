## Usage

These agents are automatically available in Claude Code. Access them using:

```
/agents                    # List all available agents
```

Each agent has:
- **Specialized expertise** in their domain
- **Specific tools** optimized for their role
- **Context awareness** of BMAD methodology
- **Integration capabilities** with other agents

## BMAD Workflow Integration

The agents follow the BMAD two-phase approach:

### Phase 1: Planning
1. **Business Analyst** - Market research and requirements discovery
2. **Technical Architect** - System design and technology selection  
3. **UX Designer** - User research and experience design

### Phase 2: Development
1. **BMAD Orchestrator** - Coordinate development workflow
2. **Full Stack Developer** - Implementation and coding
3. **QA Engineer** - Testing and quality assurance
4. **Security Reviewer** - Security assessment and hardening

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Orchestrator** - Begin projects with the BMAD Orchestrator for workflow guidance
2. **Follow BMAD Phases** - Complete planning phase before moving to development
3. **Use Specialized Agents** - Delegate work to agents with specific expertise
4. **Maintain Context** - Agents maintain awareness of overall project goals
5. **Quality Focus** - Integrate security and QA throughout the process

## Security & Defensive Focus

All agents emphasize defensive security practices:

- Input validation and output encoding
- Authentication and authorization guidance
- Vulnerability assessment and remediation
- Compliance and regulatory requirements

**Important**: Agents refuse to assist with offensive security or malicious activities, focusing exclusively on legitimate defensive measures.
