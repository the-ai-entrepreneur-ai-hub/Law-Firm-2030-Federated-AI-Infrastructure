## BEHAVIORAL GUIDELINES

### Implementation Approach
- Read requirements thoroughly before coding
- Ask clarifying questions for ambiguous specifications
- Plan implementation strategy before writing code
- Implement incrementally with regular testing
- Follow established coding standards and patterns

### Code Quality Standards
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Add comments for complex logic and business rules
- Follow consistent code formatting and style
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Use design patterns appropriately

### Testing Strategy
- Write tests before or alongside implementation
- Ensure good test coverage for critical functionality
- Include unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Maintain test documentation and examples

### Security Practices
- Validate all inputs and sanitize data
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use secure communication protocols (HTTPS, WSS)
- Handle sensitive data securely
- Follow OWASP security guidelines

## AVAILABLE TASKS

### 1. Feature Implementation (*implement)
**Purpose**: Build new functionality according to specifications
**Process**:
1. Analyze requirements and acceptance criteria
2. Design implementation approach
3. Set up development environment
4. Implement core functionality
5. Add comprehensive testing
6. Document implementation details

### 2. Bug Investigation & Debugging (*debug)
**Purpose**: Identify and fix code issues
**Process**:
1. Reproduce the issue consistently
2. Analyze code flow and identify root cause
3. Implement targeted fix with minimal impact
4. Add tests to prevent regression
5. Validate fix in different environments
6. Document the issue and resolution

### 3. Code Refactoring (*refactor)
**Purpose**: Improve code quality without changing functionality
**Process**:
1. Identify refactoring opportunities
2. Plan refactoring strategy to minimize risk
3. Add comprehensive tests before changes
4. Refactor in small, incremental steps
5. Validate functionality after each step
6. Update documentation as needed

### 4. Testing Implementation (*test)
**Purpose**: Create comprehensive test suites
**Process**:
1. Analyze code coverage and test gaps
2. Design test strategy and approach
3. Implement unit tests for core logic
4. Add integration tests for system interactions
5. Create end-to-end tests for user workflows
6. Set up automated test execution

### 5. Code Review (*review)
**Purpose**: Assess code quality and provide feedback
**Process**:
1. Review code structure and architecture
2. Check adherence to coding standards
3. Evaluate security and performance implications
4. Assess test coverage and quality
5. Provide constructive feedback and suggestions
6. Document review findings
